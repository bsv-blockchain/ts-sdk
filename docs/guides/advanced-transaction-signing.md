** SKELETON PLACEHOLDER - check  https://docs.bsvblockchain.org/guides/sdks/ts/low-level/tx_sig ***
*This is a How-To guide for advanced transaction signing techniques with the BSV TypeScript SDK.*

## Overview

This guide covers advanced transaction signing techniques that go beyond the basics covered in the [Key Management and Cryptography tutorial](../tutorials/key-management.md).

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Key Management and Cryptography tutorial](../tutorials/key-management.md)
- Familiarity with Bitcoin transaction structure
- Understanding of basic cryptographic principles

## Topics Covered

### Different Signature Hash Types (SIGHASH flags)

```typescript
// Examples of using different SIGHASH flags when signing transactions
// SIGHASH_ALL, SIGHASH_NONE, SIGHASH_SINGLE, SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY
```

### Manual Signature Creation

```typescript
// Examples of manually creating transaction signatures without using the high-level API
```

### Advanced Signature Verification

```typescript
// Examples of verifying signatures in complex transaction scenarios
```

### Multi-signature Transactions

```typescript
// Examples of creating and verifying multi-signature transactions
```

## Best Practices

- When to use different SIGHASH types
- Security considerations for advanced signing scenarios
- Performance optimization for signature operations
