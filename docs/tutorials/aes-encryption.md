**Prerequisites**: Basic TypeScript knowledge, First Transaction tutorial completed

## Learning Goals
- Understand symmetric encryption principles
- Implement AES encryption/decryption with the SDK
- Manage encryption keys securely
- Apply encryption in practical Bitcoin scenarios

## Introduction to Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a cryptographic method where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This tutorial explores how to implement AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption using the BSV TypeScript SDK.

## Setting Up Your Environment

```typescript
import { Aes, Hash } from '@bsv/sdk'
```

## Generating Encryption Keys

A secure encryption key is essential for AES. Here's how to generate and manage keys:

```typescript
// Create a secure random key for AES-256
const generateKey = () => {
  // Implementation details will go here
}
```

## Basic Encryption and Decryption

### Encrypting Data

```typescript
const encryptData = (plaintext, key) => {
  // Implementation details will go here
}
```

### Decrypting Data

```typescript
const decryptData = (ciphertext, key) => {
  // Implementation details will go here
}
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Working with Initialization Vectors (IVs)

IVs enhance security by ensuring that identical plaintext values encrypt to different ciphertext values:

```typescript
// Example code for working with IVs
```

### Encrypting Different Data Types

```typescript
// Examples for encrypting strings, buffers, etc.
```

## Practical Applications

### Secure Message Exchange

Implementing a secure messaging system using BSV and AES encryption:

```typescript
// Example implementation
```

### Encrypted Data Storage on the Blockchain

```typescript
// Example of storing encrypted data in OP_RETURN
```

## Security Considerations

- Key management best practices
- Avoiding common encryption pitfalls
- Choosing appropriate encryption modes

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to implement AES symmetric encryption using the BSV TypeScript SDK. You now understand how to generate encryption keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and apply these techniques in practical Bitcoin applications.
